# Multiple Linear Regression From Scratch

## Overview
This project consists of several Python scripts designed for data analysis, visualization, and mathematical computations related to linear algebra and regression analysis. The aim of this project was to understand the logic behind Linear Regression, Multiple Regression and Gradient Descent.
 
## Files Description

- It contains the primary logic or workflow of the project.

### `statistics.py`
- A collection of statistical functions and methods.

### `data_visualization.py`
- Dedicated to visualizing data.

### `linear_algebra.py`
- Includes functions for matrix operations.

### `linear_regression.py`
- Specifically for performing linear regression analysis.
- Helps in understanding the relationship between two variables.

### `multiple_regression.py`
- Handles multiple regression analysis.
- Useful for predicting a variable based on several variables.
